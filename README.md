# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to help Maria and her team inspect the datasets. We were told to make an analysis about the school district and use Jupyter to analyze the data better and make sure everything is correct to help Maria.

## Results:


## Summary:
Changes to the data, like replacing the reading and math scores for a certain grade level can have a big impact on the overall averages in the school district compared to others, like the rank of each district if that value before it got replaced with “NaN” was very big or very small. Another thing which can be affected is the ranking of each grade level. In this analysis, the ninth grade level grades were replaced with “NaN” instead of number grades like other grade levels at the school, which this means we can only properly compare the analysis on the 10th-12th graders, since you can’t compare something that doesn’t have a number value to one that does, which means the 9th graders from Thomas High School was not used in the analysis for.
